# FCC-File-Metadata-Microservice

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://purple-paladin.glitch.me/.
#### User stories:
  1. I can submit a form object that includes a file upload..
  2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
  3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
